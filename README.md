# Text-Prediction-using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
This repository contains a Tensorflow model made using the Keras API, the training is conducted on the corpus of  Shakespeare's works. Recurrent Neural Network model is employed for this project  that uses Gated Recurrent Units and Embedding Layers.
